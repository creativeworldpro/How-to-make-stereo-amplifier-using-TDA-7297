In this project, today I’m going to teach you making a stereo amplifier circuit. An amplifier is an electronic device or circuit which is used to increase the magnitude of the signal applied to its input.

The purpose of an amplifier is to amplify or increase the input signal to produce an output signal which is much larger than that of the input, with a similar waveform as that of the input. The principal of an amplifier is to produce an output signal that is a replica of the input signal with increased magnitude.

A signal amplifier is a circuit that uses electrical power to increase the amplitude of an incoming signal voltage or current signal. Stereo amplifiers are one of the most popular ways of improving the sound quality in different situations and conditions. That can be used at home, office, inside car, track and other cultural program also.

The article is being published in collaboration with JLCPCB. They supply high quality PCBs at a very reasonable price. They also can provide SMT circuit assembly.

We thanks to our sponsor JLCPCB for sponsoring us PCBs for this project circuit.

Circuit Connection – Step 1

To make this amplifier circuit, 1st we connect 4no and 5no leg of sound IC, 6no and 7no leg of sound IC, 8no and 9no leg of sound IC, 11no and 12no leg of sound IC.  Then we need to connect sound IC 3no and 13no leg. 


Circuit Connection – Step 2

Now we need to connect resistor with the circuit. We are using 47 KΩ resistors to make this stereo amplifier circuit. Connect this resistor one terminal with 6no leg of Sound IC and its other terminal with 3no leg of Sound IC. 

Then we need to connect 3 capacitors with the circuit. Connect 47µf/25 volt capacitor negative leg with 8no leg of sound IC and capacitor positive leg with 7no leg of sound IC.

 We utilize JLCPCB https://jlcpcb.com/RTA to printout our PCB
 
 
 Circuit Connection – Step 3
 
There are two rest capacitors. Connect 10µf/50 volt capacitor positive leg with 11no leg of Sound IC and its negative leg with Output leg of stereo volume.
 
Now we connect another 10µf/50 volt capacitor positive leg with 4no leg of Sound IC and its negative terminal with Output leg of stereo volume.


Circuit Connection – Step 4

To adjust sound, we are using B-100k stereo volume. We connect volume ground leg with 9no leg of sound IC.

To input sound, now we connect audio input cable with the circuit. Connect audio input “L” and “G” and “R” cable with input leg of stereo volume.
For output sound, we need to connect sound speaker with the circuit.

We connect left side sound speaker with 1 and 2 number leg of sound IC and right side speaker with 14 and 15 no leg of sound IC.


Circuit Connection – Step 5

For power source, we are using DC-12v power source. We need to connect sound IC 3no leg with positive leg of power source and sound IC 9no leg with negative leg of power source.

Now just plug-in power source and connect audio input cable with mobile. Play music on mobile and enjoy the high quality sound.
