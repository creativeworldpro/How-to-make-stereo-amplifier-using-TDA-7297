In this project, today Iâ€™m going to teach you making a stereo amplifier circuit. An amplifier is an electronic device or circuit which is used to increase the magnitude of the signal applied to its input. The purpose of an amplifier is to amplify or increase the input signal to produce an output signal which is much larger than that of the input, with a similar waveform as that of the input. The principal of an amplifier is to produce an output signal that is a replica of the input signal with increased magnitude. A signal amplifier is a circuit that uses electrical power to increase the amplitude of an incoming signal voltage or current signal. Stereo amplifiers are one of the most popular ways of improving the sound quality in different situations and conditions. That can be used at home, office, inside car, track and other cultural program also.
